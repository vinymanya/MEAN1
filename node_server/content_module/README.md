#Content Module

The goal of this assignment is for you to create your own first custom module and for you to not rely so much on all the node modules out there(as it's just a library like this that other people wrote) but know how to create these node modules yourself if you wanted to. Creating your own node modules would make your app.js simpler but also allow your app to be more modularized. It's always better as the app is getting complicated to have your own code do the things you need, rather than relying on 3rd party libraries someone else wrote (especially if their documentations are really poor).
